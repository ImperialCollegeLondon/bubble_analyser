## Overview

Bubble Analyser 2.0 is a robust Python application for detecting, measuring, and analyzing bubbles in images. It provides advanced image processing capabilities using watershed segmentation algorithms and Deep Learning to accurately identify and measure bubbles of various sizes and distributions. It also offers manual adjustment tools for fine-tuning segmentation results when needed, and high-fidelity ML data export to help researchers train their own custom models.

This project is significantly improved based on the first version of [Bubble Analyser (Mesa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mineng.2022.107497).

## Key Features

- **Image Processing**: Preprocess images with various transformations.
- **Bubble Detection Methods**: 
  - **Normal Watershed**: Standard watershed algorithm with triple threshold.
  - **Iterative Watershed**: Advanced algorithm that iteratively applies thresholds to detect objects at different intensity levels.
  - **Peak-Based Watershed**: Feature-based segmentation using local maxima.
  - **BubMask (Deep Learning)**: Integrated Mask R-CNN model based on [BubMask (Kim & Park, 2021)](https://github.com/ywflow/BubMask) for superior accuracy in complex lighting or overlapping conditions.
- **Interactive Ellipse Adjuster**: Manual adjustment interface for pixel-perfect refinement of detected bubbles.
- **Measurement & Calibration**: Calculate sizes, shape distributions, and convert pixel measurements to real-world units (mm) using reference images.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Linear processing workflow (Batch -> Finalise -> Export) with no mid-process interruptions.
- **Versatile Data Exports**: 
  - **Excel + Graph**: Comprehensive descriptive size data alongside PDF/CDF distribution plots.
  - **Annotated Images**: High-quality visual outputs with drawn ellipses for document reporting.
  - **ML Training Data**: Export raw images alongside perfect integer ID masks (`.npy`) allowing users to easily build new machine learning datasets from their manual corrections.

## Installation

### 1. Windows Installation (Recommended)

A fully featured Windows Installation Wizard is now available.

1. Download `BubbleAnalyser_Setup_v2.exe` from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/bubble_analyser/releases).
2. Run the installer.
3. **Important**: During installation, ensure the **"Download Deep Learning weights (~250MB)"** option is checked if you plan to use the BubMask (Deep Learning) method.
4. Launch "Bubble Analyser 2.0" from your Start Menu or Desktop.

### 2. MacOS Executable

A standalone executable for MacOS is also available in the releases section.
*(Note: If using the Deep Learning method on MacOS, the application will prompt you to download the required weights upon your first analysis).*

### 3. From Source (Developers)

To run from source or contribute to the project:

1. [Download and install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) following the instructions for your OS.
2. Clone this repository and navigate into the directory.
3. Install dependencies and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```
4. Install the pre-commit hooks (for code quality):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m bubble_analyser
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Using CNN Detection from Source**: If you attempt to use the BubMask method from source without the weights, the app will display a prompt offering to download the `mask_rcnn_bubble.h5` file automatically into the `bubble_analyser/weights/` directory.

## Exporting Results

Once your batch analysis is finalised, navigate to the **Results** tab to extract your data:

1. **Save Results (Excel + Graph)**: Creates an Excel file containing all bubble metrics (major/minor axis, equivalent diameter, area, eccentricity) and a `.png` of the generated histogram.
2. **Export Annotated Images**: Select a folder to dump all the visual previews (images overlaid with the detected ellipses) for inclusion in reports.
3. **Export ML Training Data**: Select a root folder. The app will generate an `images/` directory containing exact copies of your raw images, and a `masks/` directory containing high-fidelity `.npy` numpy arrays representing the exact integer matrix of the instance segmentation masks. This format preserves manual edits perfectly for retraining segmentation models.

## Dependencies
